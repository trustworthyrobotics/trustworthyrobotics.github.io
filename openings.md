Please understand that while I'm always excited to discuss research ideas with students, it's an unfortunate reality that I may not have the bandwidth to reply to all inquiries.

# Prospective postdocs

While I do not currently have funded positions for postdocs, there are several fellowships that could support your research in the group, such as the <a href="https://ae.gatech.edu/post-doc-fellows"> AE Postdoc Fellowship</a> or the <a href="https://ppfp.coe.gatech.edu/"> President's Postdoc Program</a>.
